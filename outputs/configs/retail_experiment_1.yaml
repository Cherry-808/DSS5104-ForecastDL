  # - xgboost # Add other models here as you create their train scripts



# --- Model Hyperparameters (Example for Prophet & Transformer) ---
# These could be nested under each model name for more complex configs

    # Add other Prophet params if needed, training script needs to read these
  

# Add hyperparameters for other models (xgboost_params, etc.)
